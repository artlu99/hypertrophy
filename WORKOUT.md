# 12 WEEK PLAN

Since you are disciplined, you must follow **Progressive Overload**. If you lift the same weight forever, you will not look different by March.

1. **Weeks 1–2:** Focus purely on form. Don't go to failure yet.
2. **Weeks 3–12:** Every week, you must do _more_ than the week before.
    - _Option A:_ Add weight (e.g., if you used 10kg last week, use 12.5kg this week).
    - _Option B:_ Add reps (e.g., if you did 10 reps last week, aim for 11 or 12 this week).

# EXCERCISES A-F

**A. Dumbbell Goblet Squat**

- _Target:_ Legs (Quads) & Glutes. Essential for a balanced physique.
- _Sets:_ 3 sets of 10–12 reps.
- _Form:_ Hold one dumbbell vertically against your chest with both hands. Squat down until your elbows touch your knees (or as low as flexible), keeping your back straight.

**B. Push-Ups**

- _Target:_ Chest & Triceps.
- _Sets:_ 3 sets to failure (do as many as you can until you can't do another).
- _Progression:_ If you can do more than 15 easily, put your feet on a chair or do Decline Push-ups. If you can't do 5, do them on your knees.

**C. Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

- _Target:_ Shoulders. This creates the "V-taper" look that makes your waist look smaller.
- _Sets:_ 3 sets of 10–12 reps.
- _Form:_ Stand straight, press dumbbells from shoulder height straight up over your head. Do not arch your back.

**D. Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)**

- _Target:_ Hamstrings & Lower Back. Good for posture.
- _Sets:_ 3 sets of 10–12 reps.
- _Form:_ Hold dumbbells in front of thighs. Keep knees slightly bent but rigid. Hinge at the hips, lowering weights toward shins while keeping back flat. Feel the stretch in hamstrings, then squeeze glutes to stand up.

**E. Dumbbell Bent-Over Row**

- _Target:_ Back & Biceps. Gives you thickness.
- _Sets:_ 3 sets of 10–12 reps.
- _Form:_ Bend over at 45 degrees (support yourself on a bench if needed). Pull dumbbells toward your hip pockets, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.

**F. Plank**

- _Target:_ Core / Abs.
- _Sets:_ 3 rounds. Hold for as long as possible.
- _Goal:_ Try to increase your time by 5-10 seconds every workout.
